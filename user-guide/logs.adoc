== Logs generated by the TameMyCerts policy module

In addition to the certification authorities regular log entries, the policy module will also write a detailed log entry if a certificate request was denied due to a policy violation or failure. Find the logs under the "Application" Event Log with the "TameMyCerts" Event Source.

|Error
|Occurs if the certification authority has the (link:https://www.gradenegger.eu/?p=1486[proven insecure^]) EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2 flag set, and a request containing the "san" attribute was passed. The policy module will deny such requests. You should consider triggering an alarm when this happens.
