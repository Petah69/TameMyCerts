== Modifying the Subject Distinguished Name (DN)

NOTE: Applies to *online* and *offline* certificate templates.

TamyMyCerts allows modifying the Subject Distinguished Name (DN) of a certificate before it gets issued. It is capable of retrieving properties from a mapped Active Directory Object and put these values into the Subject DN of a certificate.

This is useful in the following scenarios:
* Certificates issued via Autoenrollment shall have another value as the "cn" Attribute for the commonName.
* Certificates shall contain additional Relative Distinguished Names that have not been requested by the enrollee.

=== Configuring

You configure rules within the link:ds-mapping.adoc[DirectoryServicesMapping] directive. You define a *SubjectDistinguishedName* directive containing *RelativeDistinguishedName* rules.

The RelativeDistinguishedName rules can be configured as follows:

|===
|Parameter |Mandatory |Description

|Field
|yes
|The Relative Distinguished Name that shall be populated

|DirectoryServicesAttribute
|yes
|The attribute of the mapped object that shall be put into the RDN.

|Mandatory
|yes
|Specified if the attribute may be omitted if it is invalid or empty. If set to "true", requests will get denied in such a case.

|===

You may specify the following Relative Distinguished Names (RDN) for the "Field" directive:

|===
