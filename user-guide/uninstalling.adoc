== Uninstalling the TameMyCerts policy module

To uninstall the module, run *install.ps1* as Administrator. You must specify the *-Uninstall* parameter.

Example:

....
.\Install.ps1 -Uninstall
....

The script will unregister the module, copy the registry settings back and configure the Windows Default policy module as the active one.

NOTE: The install script restarts the certification authority service during installation and uninstallation.
