== Audit only mode

NOTE: Applies to *online* and *offline* certificate templates.

TameMyCerts supports an Audit-only mode, in which certificate requests get allowed regardless of the verification result. This helps by sharpening policies before applying them to existing deployments. If a certificate request would be denied in regular mode, TameMyCerts will link:logs.adoc[log this to the Event Log] of the certification authority wo allow administrators further research.

=== Configuring

You enable Audit only mode by configuring the *AuditOnly* directive.

=== Examples

....
<AuditOnly>true</AuditOnly>
....
