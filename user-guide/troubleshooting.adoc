== Monitoring and Troubleshooting

WARNING: Please be aware that if no policy file exists for a given certificate template, the request gets accepted as this would be the original behavior of the Windows Default policy module.

If a certificate request violates the defined policy, the certification authority will deny it with one of the below error codes and messages. The CA will log link:https://www.gradenegger.eu/?p=8544[Event with ID 53^]. The error code/message will also be handed over to the requesting client over the DCOM protocol as answer to the certificate request.

NOTE: TameMyCerts will also write its own link:logs.adoc[Logs] which contain detailled information about why a certificate request was denied, amongst others.
