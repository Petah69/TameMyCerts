== Denying certificate requests for insecure combinations

TameMyCerts will automatically deny certificate requests when they contain a "san" request attribute and the certification authority has the insecure link:https://www.gradenegger.eu/?p=1486[EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2] flag set. This combination can allow an attacker to completely take over your Active Directory. Therefore, this behavior can neither be configured nor disabled.

Instead of using the "san" request attribute in combination with EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2, you should ensure that certificate request already contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension. In case where this is not possible, the link:supplement-dns-names.adoc[Supplementing DNS Names and IP Addresses] can be used.
