= Integration Tests for the TameMyCerts policy module

All you need to do automatic integration testing for TameMyCerts with the link:https://github.com/pester/Pester[Pester^] PowerShell framework.

High-level steps are:

* Set up a Windows Server virtual machine.
** Remember to set an administrator password strong enough for an AD deployment.
** You can use the link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022[Windows Server 2022 Evaluation^] ISO from Microsoft (I use EN-US language).
* Copy the content of the TameMyCerts.IntegrationTests folder into _C:\IntegrationTests\_
* Deploy the environment (Domain, Certification Authority, Certificate Templates, Prerequisites) with the scripts provided in the _Lab-Setup_ directory.
* Install TameMyCerts Policy Module. Set the policy directory to _C:\IntegrationTests\Tests\_.

After that you can run pester with...

....
Invoke-Pester -Output Detailed -Path C:\IntegrationTests\Tests\
